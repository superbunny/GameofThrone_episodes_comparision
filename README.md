# Game of Thrones (TV) Episodes' ratings and comments in IMDb


In this project, we use the third-party imdb API to collect all Game of Thrones (TV) episodes' information.

The API's information is avaiable at: https://imdbpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html . 

Remember to install the API library and a wordcloud library first.

The main output of this project would be word-clouds for IMDb reviews for all episodes. Also, we will plot the rankings of ratings.
